# Front-End-Tests

These are a series of projects that contain mainly only HTML and CSS challenges that have been worked on. I have used these to primarly bolster my knowledge of semantic HTML and CSS best practices. 

The areas mainly covered in here are:<br>
ğŸš€ Semantic HTML<br>
ğŸš€ Best CSS Practices<br>
ğŸš€ Responsive Design using CSS
